- FIXED: child doesnt have a parent.
- FIXED: parent thinks its the child
- Child thinks it is its own child.

- set kernel brk segfaults

- when we call piperead, the next process turns into an address... This means
  that we corrupted something in pipe read. probably the same thing that we
  corrupted in exiting the parent before the child.
